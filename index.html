    <h1>A fake blog to show off plain html - This is an h1 tag</h1>
    <h3>by Sierra MacDonald</h3>
    <img
      src="images/brown-and-white-grizzly-bear-148182.jpg"
      alt="a cute white and brown grizzly bear"
      width="200"
      height="200"
    />
    <p>
      Why am I making a fake blog with only html? To show off what a website
      would look like NAKED! Just kidding, well... not really. This 'Blog' page
      displays the basic frame work of an HTML site. Boring? I think not! I
      learned a lot about headers, body, footers, images and more making this
      plain site. See not boring at all!
    </p>
    <h2>A fake header - This is an h2 tag</h2>
    <img
      src="images/duckling-on-black-soil-during-daytime-162140.jpg"
      alt="a cute yellow duckling"
      width="200"
      height="200"
    />
    <p>
      This is a fake paragraph about the image above. This uses a paragraph (p)
      tag
    </p>
    <h2>This is another fake header - This also uses an h2 tag</h2>
    <img
      src="./images/short-coated-black-and-brown-puppy-in-white-and-red-polka-39317.jpg"
      alt="A cute black and brown puppy"
      width="200"
      height="200"
    />
    <p>
      Why another h2? Because this header is as equal of importance as the last
      header. You can use headers from h1 all the way to h6
    </p>

    <h4>
      This is another header but less important it is an h4 I am using it for my
      unordered list below
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>fake list item #1</li>
      <li>fake list item #2</li>
      <li>fake list item #3</li>
      <li>fake list item #4</li>
    </ul>
